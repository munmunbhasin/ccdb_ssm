# ccdb_ssm

The file "ccdb_SSM_lib_reads.xlsx" contains raw reads of CcdB mutants in different bins for expression and binding.

Binding_100_nM_replicate_1 and Binding_100_nM_replicate_2 sheets corresponds to the raw reads of GyrA14 (100 nM) binding to CcdB mutants expressed  on the yeast cell surface of two biological replicates.
Binding_5_nM_replicate_1 and Binding_5_nM_replicate_2 sheets corresponds to the raw reads of GyrA14 (5 nM) binding to CcdB mutants expressed  on the yeast cell surface of two biological replicates.

Expression_replicate_1 and Expression_replicate_2 sheets corresponds to the raw reads of expression of CcdB mutants expressed  on the yeast cell surface of two biological replicates.

The above mentioned sheets have multiple colums where first, second, third and fourth colums corresponds to residues position, WT amino acid, mutant codon and mutant aminoacid respectively. The remaining columns correspond to different bins used for sorting based on 1D expression and binding.

This file  contain FACS data obtained after sorting cells for expression and binding. The sheet (FACS data) contain the information of Fluorescent intensity boundry and MFI of  different bins. Alexa Fluor 488-A Min, Alexa Fluor 488-A Max and Alexa Fluor 488-A Mean correspond to minimun, maximun and mean intensity respectively of a bin for expression. Alexa Fluor 633-A Min, Alexa Fluor 633-A Max and Alexa Fluor 633-A Mean correspond to minimun, maximun and mean intensity respectively of a bin for binding.

The last sheet of the file (Barcodes for data extraction) contain information about the barcodes and primer sequence used to amplify ccdB genes from the cells of different bins and to distinguish the reads of different bins from pooled sequencing data.
